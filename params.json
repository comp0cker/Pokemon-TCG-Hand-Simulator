The only function at the time is to analyze numerous hands for the basic Pokemon in your deck, i.e. tell you how likely it is you'll start with certain Pokemon in your hand. The second function (not yet implemented) will allow you to calculate the probability of getting a Vileplume AOR out on your first turn.",
